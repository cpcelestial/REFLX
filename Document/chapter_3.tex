\chapter{Research Methodology}

\begin{doublespace}

This study follows a step-by-step research process to develop and evaluate a light-based reaction training system for racket sports. The methodology includes gathering background information, consulting experts, and creating the initial system design. It then covers building the hardware prototype, developing the software, and testing the system with UPV athletes to measure reaction time and agility. Each stage is planned to ensure that the device is accurate, usable, and aligned with actual training needs. The process ends with analyzing the results and completing the final technical documentation.
