\section{Physiological Basis of Reaction and Agility}

\begin{doublespace}

Reaction time and agility in athletes are influenced by a complex interplay of neurophysiological factors, including perceptual-cognitive processing, neural pathways, and motor control. Reaction time encompasses the interval from stimulus detection to response initiation, modulated by sensory input (primarily visual), central nervous system processing, and efferent motor commands. Agility, defined as the ability to change direction rapidly while maintaining balance and speed, integrates these with biomechanical elements like strength and coordination \parencite{Pojskic:2019:RVU}. Neurophysiological mechanisms involve the visual cortex for stimulus detection, the prefrontal cortex for decision-making, and the basal ganglia for motor planning, with reaction accuracy linked to efficient attentional orienting and split attention across multiple stimuli \parencite{Chow:2022:RTP}. The prefrontal studies highlight that perceptual factors, such as anticipation and visual search efficiency, contribute significantly, alongside physical attributes like explosive strength and elastic strength \parencite{Yildiz:2020:RRA}. For instance, factor analyses reveal independent components: explosive strength for acceleration, elastic strength for rebound, change-of-direction speed (CODS), and maximal strength. Correlations show that faster reaction times predict superior agility test performances, such as in the Illinois Agility Test or 20-m shuttle sprint, emphasizing the role of neural efficiency \parencite{Wang:2024:TME}.

Methodologies in these studies often employ systematic reviews and correlational analyses, drawing from diverse athletic populations (e.g., team sports like soccer) \parencite{Turna:2020:EAT}. Limitations include reliance on lab-based tests that may not fully replicate field conditions, potentially underestimating contextual factors like fatigue or cognitive load \parencite{Pojskic:2019:RVU}. Implications suggest that training targeting neuroplasticity—through repeated stimuli—can enhance synaptic efficiency, reducing reaction latencies and improving agility in sports requiring rapid responses, such as basketball or racing \parencite{Chow:2022:RTP}. Patterns indicate stronger associations in high-level athletes, where cognitive fatigue and sleep quality positively correlate with prolonged reaction times, highlighting the need for holistic training approaches \parencite{Yildiz:2020:RRA}.

\section{Existing Reaction Training Technologies}

\begin{doublespace}

Commercial systems like FITLIGHT Trainer and BlazePod represent established light-based technologies for reaction training, with evidence supporting their effectiveness in enhancing athletic performance. FITLIGHT, a wireless LED sensor system, simulates game-like conditions to improve reaction time, reflexes, and cognitive functions \parencite{Hassan:2025:FTI}. Studies demonstrate its reliability, with a test-retest intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.89 and minimal detectable changes in reaction metrics \parencite{Myers:2021:TRR}. In young basketball players, a 10-week FITLIGHT intervention improved executive functions (e.g., inhibition, working memory) and fitness, though gains were comparable to traditional training, suggesting added cognitive demand without superior outcomes \parencite{Hassan:2025:FTI}. Another trial integrated FITLIGHT into small-sided games for 18 weeks, yielding significant enhancements in coordinative abilities and basic skills, outperforming controls with large effect sizes \parencite{Steff:2024:IAR}.

BlazePod, a pod-based visual-cognitive system, shows similar promise, with excellent reliability in balance activities \parencite{Cekok:2025:EBV}. A 6-month program in adolescent soccer players improved simple reaction time and cognitive tasks, but between-group differences were non-significant compared to standard training, indicating contextual benefits rather than inherent superiority \parencite{Theofilou:2022:EVS}. Methodologies typically use randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with pre-post assessments, validated via tools like the Stroop Test for cognition and TUG for effort \parencite{Cekok:2025:EBV}. Limitations include fairly small samples (n = 20-70) and short durations (6-18 weeks), risking overestimation of effects due to novelty; discrepancies arise in massed vs. distributed scheduling, with longer protocols showing sustained gains. Implications underscore these systems' role in individualized drills, boosting engagement through gamification, though high costs and proprietary designs limit accessibility for broader athletic populations \parencite{Hassan:2025:FTI}.

\section{Light- and Sensor-Based Training Research}

\begin{doublespace}

Research on light-based stimuli consistently shows enhancements in sports performance, particularly cognitive-motor integration and agility. A 6-week RCT using Witty SEM lights for car racing drivers improved cognitive abilities and cardiorespiratory fitness, with significant group-time interactions \parencite{Horvath:2022:ARA}. In basketball, light stimulation exercises enhanced attention focus (visual/auditory) and skilled hand speed, with pre-post improvements attributed to neuroplastic adaptations \parencite{Shimi:2025:AML}. VR-adapted light tasks revealed attentional mechanisms, with orienting speed predicting performance, emphasizing split attention for larger stimuli arrays \parencite{Shimi:2025:AML}. Soccer-specific lighting interventions (6 months) manipulated visual processing, reducing reaction times under varied conditions, though transfer to matches was inferred rather than directly measured \parencite{Theofilou:2022:EVS}.

Methodologies favor RCTs with tools like the Vienna Test System for cognition and breath-by-breath gas analysis for physiology, ensuring objective evidence \parencite{Horvath:2022:ARA}. Limitations encompass single-blinding, uncontrolled nutrition, and lab-based focus, potentially inflating effects; patterns show greater benefits in open-skill sports, with discrepancies in exercise vs. rest conditions \parencite{Zhao:2024:RPS}. Implications highlight light stimuli's potential for dual physical-cognitive gains, transferable to agility-dependent sports, but call for ecological validity in future studies \parencite{Shimi:2025:AML}.

\section{Wireless Communication Protocols in IoT}

\begin{doublespace}

The rapid evolution of Internet of Things (IoT) and embedded-device systems has introduced novel communication protocols designed for low-latency, low-power, peer-to-peer connectivity. Among these, ESP-NOW stands out as a connectionless, peer-to-peer protocol by Espressif that operates on the Wi-Fi PHY layer while bypassing the full TCP/IP stack, which reduces handshake overhead and enables low-latency broadcast and one-to-many messaging for ESP32 and ESP8266 devices \parencite{Becker:2025:POE}. Multiple empirical evaluations have assessed ESP-NOW’s performance under different environmental and traffic conditions.

An outdoor performance study reported one-way transmission delays as low as approximately 1–2 ms even at extended distances, showing that ESP-NOW maintains stable latency and packet delivery across open-field environments \parencite{Becker:2025:POE}. A lab analysis further confirmed these results by comparing ESP-NOW directly with Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), finding that ESP-NOW exhibited measurably faster transmission times, significantly lower jitter, and more stable multi-node communication—attributes essential for synchronized sensor systems \parencite{Labib:2021:ENS}. Similarly, a comparative evaluation showed that ESP-NOW outperformed both classic Bluetooth and standard Wi-Fi in key metrics such as transmission speed, barrier resistance, and latency, including tests through walls and indoor obstacles \parencite{Eridani:2021:CPS}. An indoor performance evaluation of ESP-NOW reported high packet-delivery ratios and consistent millisecond-level timing across typical indoor IoT deployment ranges \parencite{Urazayev:2023:IPE}. These studies show that ESP-NOW reliably achieves one-way transmission times in the range of about 1–5 ms with low jitter—performance characteristics.

\section{Identified Gaps in Literature}

\begin{doublespace}

The literature reveals notable gaps, particularly the scarcity of open-source, customizable systems for individualized athlete training. While commercial tools like FITLIGHT dominate, they are proprietary and costly, limiting adaptation for diverse needs \parencite{Seckin:2023:RWT}. Emerging technologies emphasize open-source platforms for tele-exercise, enabling collaborative customization via AI and IoT, yet only 9\% of trials target healthy populations, with inadequate standardization of training parameters \parencite{Rebelo:2023:FDA}. Gaps include high dropout in asynchronous modes, data security concerns, and underexplored adherence factors \parencite{Rebelo:2023:FDA}. Methodologies in gap analyses rely on narrative reviews, highlighting sustainability challenges in open-source projects \parencite{Seckin:2023:RWT}. This implicates the need for accessible systems to democratize training, addressing disparities in research on healthy athletes.

Another notable gap is the absence of research exploring low-latency wireless communication protocols—particularly ESP-NOW—in the design of reaction-training technologies. Existing systems largely depend on Bluetooth, which suffers from variable transmission delays and connectivity interruptions. No current studies assess whether protocols like ESP-NOW can enhance timing precision or improve synchronization in multi-station athletic training systems, underscoring a significant technological gap this research intends to address.
